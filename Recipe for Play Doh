            <td>1/2 a cup of cornstarch<br>
            1 cup of baking soda <br>
            3/4 of a cup of water </td>

            </tbody>
        </table>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a pot with no heat, add the cornstarch, baking soda and water then stir.

 <br>
        <br>
       <strong> Step 2: </strong>  Turn on your stove to medium heat. <br>
<br>
 <strong> Step 3: </strong> Continue stirring the mixture. It will start to bubble slightly and that’s when it happens really fast. It will begin to turn solid. Once a ball starts to form (4-5 minutes) take your pot off the heat.
<br>
 <strong> Step 3: </strong> Place your dough onto a piece of parchment paper. Let it cool, it will be very hot. To speed the cooling process, flip it over and knead it a bit as it’s cooling down. Be careful, it’s HOT. Once it cools down completly, you may play with it.
